      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I never imagined pursuing software development as a career. Even though I initially became interested in tech through AI and machine learning, I chose to pursue web development because of its real-world, applicable skills.
         I see tech as a way to achieve a better quality of life for myself and my family. Through my journey of becoming a software developer, I’ve learned a lot—not just about writing code, but about problem-solving, persistence, and the creativity it takes to turn ideas into something real. Each project has taught me how to embrace challenges, adapt quickly, and keep pushing forward even when the solution isn’t obvious.
         What excites me most now is the opportunity to keep growing—building applications that not only solve problems, but also make everyday life better for the people who use them. This journey has only just begun, and I’m motivated by the idea that the skills I’m developing today will let me contribute to something bigger tomorrow.
